 Usage guide for dog:

	1. Call "make" to create the executable file.

	2. Call "make clean" to remove the object file.

	3. Call "./dog [input ...]" to run dog on inputs.

		a. Input can be: file names, "-", empty, or any terminal
		   command usuable with cat that is not a flag (such as ">").

		b. Input can be any length, nothing or 20 files for example.
		   These inputs only need a space between each other.

	4. When satisfied with dog, call "make spotless" to remove the executable.
